Introduction
------------

`Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`_ |r| is a generic open source
automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven
development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain
text syntax and it can be extended easily with generic and custom libraries.

Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It is
implemented using `Python <http://python.org>`_ which is also the primary
language to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting
of various generic libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects.
For more information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, see
http://robotframework.org.

Robot Framework project is hosted on GitHub_ where you can find source code,
an issue tracker, and some further documentation. Downloads are hosted on PyPI_.

Robot Framework development is sponsored by non-profit `Robot Framework Foundation
<http://robotframework.org/foundation>`_. If you are using the framework
and benefiting from it, consider joining the foundation to help maintaining
the framework and developing it further.
