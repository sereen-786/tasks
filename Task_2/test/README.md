## Introduction of Robot Framework

[Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org) is a generic open source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain text syntax and it can be extended easily with generic and custom libraries.
Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It is implemented using [Python](http://python.org) which is also the primary language to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects. For more information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, see [robot framework website](http://robotframework.org.)
